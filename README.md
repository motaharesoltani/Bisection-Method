# BisectionMethod-Python
The simplest root finding algorithm is the bisection method. This program implements Bisection Method for finding real root of nonlinear equation in python programming language. 
This program shows you table and graph related to the function and the root. I hope you find it useful :) If the codes have a problem, please email me.
